## 2. Register Nationally

YDSA is a member-driven organization that requires your dues to operate! To have voting power in YDSA@UWM meetings, you must be a dues-paying member of the organization. Don't worry! These dues are very low and can be covered or even waived if you need!

Follow the [national YDSA guide to register](https://y.dsausa.org/join/).
